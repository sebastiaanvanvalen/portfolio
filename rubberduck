Having a lot of problems with the validation checks in the game. should you be able to do what you do...

The game needs:

If you end up with board dice that contain only one value you dont have, but it's not a doodle and also you dont have a doodle in your stack

* available tiles

* fixed dice score
* occassions (the available values(sets) that remains in the thrown dice)
* valuesInPosession
* valuesNotInPosession
* distanceToDeath1 (you have a doodle in possession. The highest available tile value - diceScore)
* distanceToDeath2 (you have no doodle in possession. The higest available tile value - 1 doodle)

* distanceToSurvive (the lowest available tile value - fixed dice score)



After throwing the dice:
    - are you instantly dead?
        - when you have a dice value and in combi with all the thrown value combinations you overtrow the highest available tilevalue

    - are you inevetable dead?
        - when you have a dicevalue but missing a doodle. There is no doodle in the thrown values and every combination of values - 1 doodleValue is higher then the highest available tilevalue
        - your dicescore in combination with the highest possible throw is to low to match any available tile.


    - are you forced to throw?
    - can you, or can you not, pick a tile.

After fixing dice:
    - you cant pick a value you allready have
    - you cant pick 





    - Do you allready have this value?
    - Are you dead with this value?
    - did you pick values and

maybe a new evaluation system that evaluates every situation
